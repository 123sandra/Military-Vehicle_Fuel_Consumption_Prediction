# Military-Vehicle_Fuel_Consumption_Prediction
Developed a Model using Machine learning XGBoost Regressor to predict the Military vehicle Fuel Consumption in Liter per kilometer on different terrains.🚨 <br>

Fuel Consumption Forecasting for Military Vehicles is a machine learning application designed to estimate fuel usage for defense operations. <br>
Leveraging __XGBRegressor (R²: 0.90, MAE: 1.46 L/km)__, it analyzes inputs like vehicle weight, horsepower, terrain (road🛣️, desert🏜️, forest🏔️, snow❄️), origin etc to deliver highly accurate predictions. <br>

Deployed via Streamlit Community Cloud, the interactive UI enables users to input parameters and receive real-time fuel estimates. This tool supports efficient mission planning and resource allocation in military logistics. <br>
The output is in *liters per kilometer*, showing how much fuel is needed for each kilometer traveled.<br>
